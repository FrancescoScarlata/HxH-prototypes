# HxH-prototypes

This project will be used to prototype some elements of the famous hunter x hunter manga/anime.

In particular, i'm interested in the Nen interaction and how it can be used.
I won't start from the game design PoV, but just prototyping first a sample of skill tree for this kind of element. Once that is done, i'll start thinking about a very single player experience that can use that kind of abilities/powers.

It mostly likely will feature an early phantom brigade fanfic story i guess. we'll see.
